With the advent of dating apps in the market the ongoing demand of better products and services is ever-growing in this domain. Creating a community centered across dating and growing that community to cater the needs of the users of the service. The ongoing trend of users hopping across the dating apps is a clear indicator of a demand of a better service in this domain. Having a clear vision also helps in promoting the company's goal. Separating the firm precisely with the matrimonial services or integrating with it shows a clear sign of a company's long term vision.

The client wanted to have a very thin line between the dating and matrimony space and promote the company more into the dating domain through clear communication across all the marketing channels.
