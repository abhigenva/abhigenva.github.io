service: UX Design
client: Hari Singh
shortDescription: A restaurant that also delivers food is pretty common. The thing
  that is not too common is that they also grow all their ingredients used for the 
  food produced. Everything is organic and grown in-house to give a special and an 
  elusive taste to the food that you can find nowhere else.
challenge: Organic food restaurants are not too common and client wanted to show
  and market his restaurant in that way to the nearby area. Also to attract the tourist
  to his restaurant who wanted to experience something new by advertising a video showcasing
  a user experience to a restaurant from food to service.
solution: Designing the website keeping the user in mind and at the forefront of desing concepts
  to create an immersive experience for the user and sharing the story of the the business to 
  connect with the user on an emotional level. Helping him create a video to showcase the 
  growth and also the preparation of food right from farm to plate of the user.

Restaurant industry is competitive and showcasing ourself separate from the competition is a good and effective way to build an audience and a clientele. Organic farming is growing and the demand among the customers is also growing and having an organic farm restaurant is unique and drawing attention in the nearby area. Getting press is also certainly much easy as compared to other restaurants. This is what separates the client from the rest of the competition. Keeping the user in mind and devising an unforgetable experience with the good quality ingredients that are grown in-house. The taste of the organic food is also much better than the other food. Having a fixed food items on the menu and growing the organic produce accordingly. Having a blend of organic farm produce and commercial food products adds more taste for the customers that brings the cravings for the customer and forces him/her to visit that particular restaurant again and over. Creating an experience for the customer that adds that restaurant among his favorites and also makes him/her the brand advocate for the restaurant.
